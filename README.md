# README

This project creates a [consul](http://consul.io) environment on Vagrant, following the setup [described by Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-consul-in-a-production-environment-on-ubuntu-14-04).
 It is meant to provide a quick way to get a consul installation to play and experiment with.
